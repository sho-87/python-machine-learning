# Logistic Regression

* **or.py**
  * Logistic regression for learning an OR logic gate
* **and.py**
  * Logistic regression for learning an AND logic gate
* **and_no_bias.py**
  * Logistic regression, without a bias unit, to show that the an AND gate can't be learned if the linear separate crosses the origin
* **xor_logistic.py**
  * Logistic regression for an XOR gate. Demonstrates why XOR can't be solved without a hidden layer
